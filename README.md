# Terminal Exercises

Please complete the following problems in terminal. 

## Problem 1

Build the basic structure for a website. You do this via the file system every time you create a new website. This time though, all actions must be done via terminal.

A typical website looks like this:

```
myWebSite/
  assets/
  styles/
    main.css
  index.html
```

Using terminal, create the folder structure displayed above. 

## Problem 2

While we can do the steps above for every website we build, it might be a lot easier to just copy and paste that above folder over and over again.

Using the terminal, copy the **entire** myWebsite folder contents to a new folder, called **myNextSite**.

Do this two more times, naming the folders **myNextSite2** and **myNextSite3**.

## Problem 3

Create a new folder called **websites**.

Move your **myNextSite2** into your **websites** folder. 
Move your **myNextSite3** into your **websites** folder.

## Problem 4

Without cd'ing into it, list *every* *single* *file* that exists in **website** directory.

## Problem 5: CHALLENGE

With one line, list all the *.css* files that exist in **website** directory
